      "answer": "The graph shows the normalized per-BS transmit power required for TOA-based localization in frequency-selective channels. The normalized power is defined as the ratio of the transmit power required for TOA-based localization to the transmit power required for conventional TDD systems. The number of blocks NC is the number of blocks used for TOA-based localization. The constraints R and Q are the maximum number of reflections and the maximum angle spread, respectively. The values of R and Q are chosen to be 3 and (0.3δ)2, respectively. The values of M, NB , and NM are the number of BSs, the number of BS antennas, and the number of MSs, respectively. The value of N is the number of subcarriers. The graph shows that the normalized per-BS transmit power decreases as the number of blocks NC increases.
